# Sentinel in Axum

> axum is unique in that it doesnâ€™t have its own bespoke middleware system and instead integrates with tower. This means the ecosystem of tower and tower-http middleware all work with axum.

That is, we can simply reuse [sentinel-tower](https://crates.io/crates/sentinel-tower) in [Axum](https://crates.io/crates/axum).

An example is provided in the `example` directory.
